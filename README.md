#### Add-on to quickly display times and scores for today's Philadelphia sports games.

## Disclaimers

* Occasional updates, so expect this to be outdated from time to time.
* For Edge, updates take a long time to be published (7 business days), so if anything is broken, it will take a bit before changes are applied
* Chrome requires a fee to publish add-ons, so I will not be publishing to Chrome Store for now
